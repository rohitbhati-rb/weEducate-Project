            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to
                the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state
                governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as
                large as India, now with 28 states and seven union territories 1, this means that the potential for
                variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is
                vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
                state-level programs and policies.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation
                of government schools and private schools can be misleading.[22] However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi
                Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in India, it is said that
                For sensible education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of
                the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor
                policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children’s life chances.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded
                a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of
                particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential
                quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest
                university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
                taught in Ariano -Páli language.
                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.</p>
